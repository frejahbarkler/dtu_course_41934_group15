## **41943 A2: OpenBIM Analysis**

#### *Group 15. (s203634 & s203595)*

- The choosen use case is to verify the structural load capacity

- This is inteded for structural engineers

- To this knowledge on loads cases and structural integrety have been used.

- In the script IFC concepts of extracting informations related to structural components have been used, as well as concepts of loading models, and exporting information to excel files. In the further script it is exspecting to used IFC concepts of extracting the geometry of the model.

- The script requires a structural analysis

- We are particularily interestid in structural components which are load bearing

- Uses cases that needs to bee done for our use case,  is calculations of the geometry of the building

- The input data for the use case it first and foremost an IFC model. Beside the user will be asked for input values related to the materials used and location specific values in further developed script.

- Other uses cases waiting for our use case to be completed could be use cases determining the price of the building,or shop lists.
