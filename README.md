# 41934 Advanced BIM - Group 15
### *s203634 &amp; s203595*

The primary aim of the course is to teach us how to gather, analyze and communicate building information from IFC models for real architectural engineering challenges. Finally we will teach our peers a concept we have learnt in the course. To create OpenBIM data, processes and tools that we can learn from, the course has the following principles:

1. Open, FAIR and Standardised
2. Reusable and Maintainable
3. Agnostic and Guiding

This requires interoperability and standardisation; therefore this course focuses on Open BIM data and standards. Excitingly there is an emerging emerging ecosystem of OpenBIM tools supported by IfcOpenShell and others that provide an OpenBIM alternative to contemporary inoperable closed BIM tools and data. We believe that University education has a responsibility to support the transition in the AEC to OpenBIM data and standards. To achieve this, the Advanced BIM course at DTU supports five emerging OpenBIM Roles.
