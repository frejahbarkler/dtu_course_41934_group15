*Please check out our guided tutorial of how to use our tool: "HowToRun.pdf" or watch the tutorial video through the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmxP8bfCp9U*

**The goal of our tool** is to support the user to verify the structural load capacity. 

This tool is thereby intended for structural engineers, and requires a structural analysis, why we are particularly interested in structural components which are load bearing. 

To this knowledge on loads cases and structural integrity have been used.

- In the script IFC concepts of extracting informations related to structural components have been used, as well as concepts of loading models, using user-input, updating the propertysets of the ifc-model, and exporting information to excel files. 

#### **Use cases**

The input data for the use case is an IFC model. 

The tool requires, that geometry assigned to the structural elements have been loaded into the IFC model beforehand.
