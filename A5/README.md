# A5: Project Reflection

### Personal development
At the beginning of the course, we had no experience with OpenBIM and barely any experience with Python programming. We have a background as BSc in Civil Engineering, with a focus on structural constructions. We signed up for the course to learn about OpenBIM, in order to support the development of methods that share data, tools and knowledge to promote circularity within the building industry. Throughout the course we have developed from being complete beginners (level 0) within all OpenBIM compenties to become either a level 1, 2 or 3 in the three compenties below: 

**OpenBIM Modeller**     Level 0 -> Level 2 

**OpenBIM Analyst**      Level 0 -> Level 3 

**OpenBIM Manager**      Level 0 -> Level 1 

### Using OpenBIM knowledge in the future
We still need to learn how to apply a wider range of packages and installations for Python as well as Blender. This would be beneficial in the sense that more coding opportunities would appear, and the script could be made much more advanced.  

In our future carrier we imagine OpenBIM would be useful to collaborate with different fields and companies despite of initially BIM programmed used.  

### Evaluating the course
The process of the course definitely inspired us for a later thesis – mostly regarding the knowledge that there is a lack of tools to handle data across different BIM softwares, which can make it impossible to access building information from outdated software-versions. We now know that OpenBIM can be a path to develop circular economy within the construction sector for instance – because the tool will make us able to access data from old buildings, when handling them later on in the maintainment or demolition processes etc.  

We wouldn’t necessarily have liked to be given less choices in the use cases, however it could have been nice to be introduced to different examples and been doing common brainstorming in class. What else could have been interesting, would be to meet other groups earlier in the process to discuss our different perspectives and takes on the assignment, and in that sense inspire each other.  

If tools it meant in the sense of programmed introduced / given as an option to work in we find it reasonable at this point in the course. In the very beginning, it could have been useful with a better overview of the different options and the differences between these, especially for the ones who have been working with neither of the tools. However, we find it reasonable with the option of different tools, as there are many opportunities and it in that sense reflects the complexity of OpenBIM, as well as the fact that people come from many different backgrounds with different knowledge and expertise (if any). 

During the group discussion in the final lesson, it became clear to us the difference between the programs the script was written in.  

### Feedback on the tutorials

Finally, we've got some feedback from our peers at the course. Based on their feedback, it first of all clarified that our intention was understood (a tool for a structural engineer to get a quick overview of the structural construction, without having to open a whole model in its 3D software. The engineer could thereby get a quick estimate of the self-weight and location of the structural elements, and further on followed by strength parameters for different capacity checks.)

From the feedback we took some suggestions on improving our modelling of our script. These etc. relates the modeling of the geometry as this currently requires the user to do some minor changes in the blender model used for the script, for it to be computed. An improvement in this relation would be to write a code computing this without necessarily opening the program of Blender. 

Furthermore, there are most definitely many parts that could be advanced much further than the current level of the script. This includes making the script and information given by the user less general and more specific for the single elements considered. An example of this, could be that in the current script the user is asked to define some values for the different materials in the script, however this does not consider the fact that even though several of elements might be assigned the same material type the strength class could vary. This is particularly true for the steel elements which are assigned strength values depending on the thickness of the cross-section, which is unprecise as this could vary within the elements. In addition to the comment on the coding of the geometry a more advanced coding of this could improve the prior noted issues of the materials. 

It seemed that our project was well scoped and simple to tune in to. One point that was commented should have been improved, was the tutorial of the prior measures to running the script. It should in this relation have been specified more how the geometry should be extracted from the model in Blender. 

### Future ambitions with Advance use of OpenBIM
We will definitely consider including OpenBIM in our thesis. Both with the reason that it can be beneficial for others to have access to our data and results, the possibility of using the tool themselves, check the calculations for mistakes for instance, or to develop further on it, and last but not least promoting that sharing data will led to common development within the construction sector in the future. 

Hopefully, we will be using OpenBIM in our professional life in the next 10 years. And if not, our role is to promote OpenBIM and introduce it to employers and employees, in order to integrate circularity and push further development of an OpenBIM future. 

## Wrap up

We found that the course was built on mainly self learning, which would also correspond to the point where we learnt the most. By trying different methods and codes, and by orienting us in example and thought that others had shared online. 

The steapest learning curve was the journey from the first assignment, handling an ifc file in excel to the third assignment, using ifcopenshell to access data, handle it, and thereby further implement new information in an old model. Before the course, we only had introduction to programming, why we can also agree that we developed our own programming skills a lot. 

The most educational lesson, in directly relation to coding and OpenBIM, we found was the session of talking with other groups and reviewing their work and takes on the project. 

Other than that, we really enjoyed the guest lectures from people working on relevant projects or coming from companies. That have been very interesting and inspiring.
